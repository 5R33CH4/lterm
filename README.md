# lterm: Online bash terminal(emulator) tutorial

Check out the site live at **<a href="https://sr6033.github.io/lterm/">lterm</a>**.

**lterm** is an online **Terminal Eminulator**. It is a step by step tutorial that will teach you the **bash** commands by making you execute them. Nothing is better than learning by doing.

It is fully online and doesn't require any extra shitty access. Being an emulator, it only virtualizes a terminal environment and so the commands executed doesn't effect the server or your local machine. 

### List of commands available presently
